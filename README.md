# Power_BI_HR_Analytics_Dashboard

Iâ€™ve created this dashboard to provide insights into employee attrition within the organization. This dashboard encompasses various factors such as education, age, job roles, salary, and years at the company, enabling a comprehensive understanding of the workforce dynamics.


Objective:

Help an organization improve employee performance and employee retention (reduce attrition) by creating an HR Analytics dashboard.


Key Insights:

Education: Life science majors have the highest attrition rate among employees (38%)

Age: The majority of employees depart the organization within the 26-35 age group (116 people)

Job Role: Laboratory Technicians are the most departed the organization (62)

Salary Slab: Salaries up to 5K have the highest number of attrition among the employees (163).

Gender: Male employees exhibit higher attrition (140) compared to female employees (79).

Years at the Company: Employees who work less than two years mostly leave the company.


Recommendations:

To mitigate attrition, it is essential to implement targeted strategies such as enhancing compensation packages, offering tailored professional development, improving job satisfaction, and fostering a positive work environment.

Focus on competitive pay for roles and demographics with high attrition.
Develop specific retention programs based on job roles and educational backgrounds.
Improve onboarding experiences and create career paths for new hires.
Introduce wellness programs and career development initiatives to address job satisfaction issues.
Implement policies that support work-life balance and inclusivity across all genders.


This dashboard highlights key areas of concern in employee retention, particularly in roles with lower salaries, shorter tenures, and specific educational backgrounds like Life Sciences and Medical degrees.

Understanding these trends can help the organization target retention strategies more effectively, focusing on younger employees and those in lower salary brackets to reduce turnover.
